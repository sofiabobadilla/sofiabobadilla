### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Sofia, a PhD student at KTH, Royal Institute of Technology Sweden. 
My research focus is automated program repair for smart contracts and smart contract security.

The first milestone of my PhD is already on arXiv, have a look : 

[Do Automated Fixes Truly Mitigate Smart Contract Exploits?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04600)

Are you a master's student interested in smart contract research? Join our team. We have several [master thesis topics](https://www.monperrus.net/martin/topics).
Are you a fellow PhD student working in the same neighborhood? DO reach out, information exchange is crucial for science. sofbobATkthDOTse
